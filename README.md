# web repo

This is the website that is live at gitcoin.co

## What

Functionally, the app has several key features:

* Smart Contracts -- Where bounties are stored and indexed.
* Brochureware -- Describes the project
* Bounty Explorer -- A searchable index of all of the work available in the system.
* Bounty Submission / Acceptance flow -- Interface between the application and web3.

Technically, the system is architected:

* __Web3__ The main source of truth for the system is the Ethereum blockchain.  Check out the [smart contracts](https://github.com/gitcoinco/smart_contracts).
* __Web2__ This part of the app is built with Python, Django, Postgres, and a handful of other tools that are common in the web2 ecosystem.
* __Web 3 Bridge__ This is the bridge between web3 and the rest of the application.  Mostly built in javascript(web3js) and python(web3py).
* __Brochureware__ Just a nice little landing page telling folks what the Gitcoin project is.
