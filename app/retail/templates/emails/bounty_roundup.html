                Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
            </p>
            <p>
                Were any of you at ETHWaterloo in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ this past weekend?  
            </p>
            <p>
                 I got to see Vitalik speak about Byzantium &amp; privacy on the blockchain.  What a presence he is!  Speaking of Byzantium, it's live.  ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ  I'm double-rainbowing over here because the fees on the mainnet are now so low :)
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the other outcomes of the ETHWaterloo hackathon is the <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/ios">Gitcoin iOS App proof of concept</a>.  If you'd like to help move it from proof of concept to production app, I'd <a href="https://gitcoin.co/slack">love to hear from you</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Devcon3 is only 2 weeks out.  I'm pretty excited for all the talks, the beach, and to hang out with other OSS dvs.  Are you going? <a href="https://gitcoin.co/slack">Say whats up on slack</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus right now at Gitcoin Core HQ is <strong>Pilot Programs</strong>.  I've still got a couple pilot program slots left.  Want to work together?  Reach out <a href="https://gitcoin.co/slack">on slack</a>.
