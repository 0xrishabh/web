    <h2>Anti-Fraud Research Group</h2>
    <div class="intro purple">Gitcoin grants is the number one funding mechanism in the Gitcoin ecosystem, delivering
      $4mm/quarter to builders of digital public goods. Gitcoin Grants is built on <a href="https://wtfisqf.com"
        target="_blank">QF</a>, a mechanism for funding the commons, which is built on the assumption of sybil/collusion
      resistance - These are open research problems.</div>

    <p>This working group will be diving deep on solving these unsolved research issues, with a goal of keeping the
      Gitcoin Grants fraud tax down + maintaining Gitcoinâ€™s legitimacy.</p>

    <h3 class="aqua">Suggested Quests</h3>
    <li>Quadratic Funding can be gamed by creating multiple identities and multiple grants, but big-tech identity
      systems are intrusive honeypots. Build on & support ecosystem efforts to create sybil resistance</li>
    <li>Analyze Gitcoin Grants data + come up with policy proposals to prevent collusion</li>
    <li>Using <a href="http://proofofpersonhood.com" target="_blank">proofofpersonhood</a>, GTC could allow
      decentralized identity, raising the cost to attack QF without the negative consequences of big-tech</li>
    <li>A product experience that stakes tokens on people you vouch for, giving that person community-earned reputation
    </li>
